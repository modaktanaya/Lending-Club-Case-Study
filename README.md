## General Information
Lending Club is place facilitating different kinds of loans for different purposes. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicantâ€™s profile.
We have the data from Lending Club about past loan applicants and whether they 'defaulted' or not.
The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.


## Conclusions
- Higher income decreases defaulter ratio.
- Higher interest rates increases defaulter ratio.
- When we go from category A-G, the defaulter ratio increases and also the interest rates are high for categories D, E, F and G.
- Higher the number of terms, higher the defaulter ratio.
- High and very high installments tend to have higher defaulter ratio.
- Category A and B have low interest rates as well as low defaulter ratio, so more loans can accepted for that applicants.
- High income is also a feature of customers that pays loans, so more loans can be accepted for customers with high income.
- Unsecured Purposes like small business and medical loans tend to be charged off.
- More number of derogatory public records and inquiries for last 6 months can increase the chances of being defaulter.
